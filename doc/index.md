# Implementation of Financial Models

This course will teach you how to use mathematics to model financial
products and implement them using modern C++.

## Prerequisites
Version control is an essential tool for creating software.
Install a [git](http://git-scm.com/) client and read the documentation.

Create an account at [Codeplex](https://codeplex.com).
Use the [Discussions](http://libfms.codeplex.com/discussions) tab
for any project related questions.

You will need a modern [C++](http://www.isocpp.org/) compiler.

- Windows: [Visual Studio 2013 for Windows](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx)
- Linux: Either [gcc 4.8.3](http://gcc.gnu.org/)
or [llvm 3.4.1](http://llvm.org/)
- OSX: [XCode 5.1](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) or
[OSX-gcc-installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer)
(Apple Developer account required.)

For Windows install Excel and the [xll](https://xll.codeplex.com) library.

## Books
No books are required for this course. You will be assigned readings
available on the internet to be discussed at the beginning of each class.

There is a new C++ in town. We will be taking advantage of that in this
course. Below are references to the latest developments.

- [A Tour of C++](http:www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html)
is a quick overview of modern C++ at the expert level
- [Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++](http:www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)
is a beginner level introduction to modern C++.
- [Elements of Modern C++ Style](http://herbsutter.com/elements-of-modern-c-style/)
is a brief on-line guide.
