<p><i>“The fundamental idea is simply to improve design and programming through abstraction. You want to hide details, you want to exploit any commonality in a system, and you want to make this affordable.”</i></p>

<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
<p>The <em>time value of money</em> is called the <em>discount</em>. A <em>zero coupon bond</em> indicates the price today of 1 unit of currency received in the future. Let <span class="math">\(D(t)\)</span> denote of 1 unit received at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. The <em>(continuously compounded) spot rate</em> is defined by <span class="math">\(D(t) = \exp(-tr(t))\)</span> and the <em>(continuously compounded) forward rate</em> by <span class="math">\(D(t) = \exp(-\int_0^t f(s)\,ds)\)</span>.</p>
<p>A <em>fixed income instrument</em> is determined by cash flows <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span> at times <span class="math">\(t_j\)</span>. Since it is a portfolio of zero coupon bonds, its value is <span class="math">\(\sum_j c_j D(t_j)\)</span>. Given a collection of fixed income instruments <span class="math">\((c_j^k, t_j^k)\)</span> having prices <span class="math">\(p_k\)</span> we can find many discount curves such that <span class="math">\[
    p_k = \sum_j c_j^k D(t_j^k)
\]</span> for all <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. The <em>bootstrap</em> method gives a canonical way of building a discount curve. Let <span class="math">\(u_k = \max_j t_j^k\)</span> be the maturity of the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-th instrument. We look for a forward curve that is piece-wise flat with breakpoints a <span class="math">\(u_k\)</span>. Assume the <span class="math">\(u_k\)</span> are increasing. Given a discount curve out to <span class="math">\(u_k\)</span>, we can extend the forward to <span class="math">\(u_{k+1}\)</span> in a way that reprices the <span class="math">\(k+1\)</span>-st instrument.</p>
<h3 id="instruments">Instruments</h3>
<p>Typical fixed income instruments are cash deposits, forward rate agreements, futures, and swaps. These are real world instruments that have associated indicative data. For example, a <em>cash deposit</em> is determined by its notional, tenor, rate, and day count basis. There are also various settlement conventions to deal with dates that fall on weekends, holidays, or the end of month.</p>
<p>The calculation dates associated with these instruments must be converted to time in years since some epoch, usually the <em>settlement date</em>.</p>
<h3 id="datetime">Datetime</h3>
<p>The <code>datetime</code> library helps convert between absolute dates and time in years. We choose the convention that one year consists of 365.25 days(<code>DAYS_PER_YEAR</code>). This is slightly arbitrary, but as long as it is used consistently there is no problem in practice.</p>
<h1 id="homework">Homework</h1>
<p>Due October 20 at 5pm. Late homework will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Pull a fresh copy of <a href="https://git01.codeplex.com/libfms">libfms</a>. In Visual Studio go to <code>Team Explorer</code>, <code>Home</code>, <code>Branches</code>, <code>New Branch</code>. Use your codeplex id for the name of your branch. Make sure <code>Checkout branch</code> is selected. Click on <code>Create Branche</code>.</p>
<p>Find your codeplex id in the solution. (Ctrl-F is your friend.) If you are adding tests, use the existing tests as a model. If you are implementing an add-in, use existing add-ins as a model.</p>
<p>Commit your code and push to the repository.</p>
