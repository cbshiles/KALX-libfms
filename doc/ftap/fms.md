This slim pamphlet describes a unified approach to pricing, hedging,
and evaluating the risk of derivative securities.  The foreign exchange,
fixed income, equity, and commodity arenas have developed models that get
attached to a string of pioneers: Garman-Kohlhagen, Black-Scholes/Merton,
Heston, Black-Derman-Toy, Vasicek, Heath-Jarrow-Morton, Gabillion. The
simple fact is that they are all stochastic processes with parameters
that get tuned to the market and are then used to come up with a putative
price based on the cost of the initial hedge. The current theory is
not very good at evaluating the practical risks involved with the
theoretical hedge.

You may not understand the following statement yet: there is only one
mathematical model for derivative securities, a vector-valued stochastic
process; it is simply a matter of how you parameterize it.
The goal is to make this obvious and even useful.
